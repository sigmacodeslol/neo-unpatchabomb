# neo-unpatchabomb
This is a way improved word bomb script (improved by me) from github.com/MarsQQ/Unpatchabomb

# Usage
## 1.
Copy the content of (neo-unpatchabomb.lua)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigmacodeslol/neo-unpatchabomb/refs/heads/master/neo-unpatchabomb.lua]:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sigmacodeslol/6362d1b364db66ee49cb13c5f3aa18d9/raw/d7ea45b251580e03635c4ba952a56f83ccad49a4/wordbomb.lua'), true)()
```
## 2.
Paste it into your executor, I would rather use those cheap or free executors that we can trust. Mines is Xeno v1.2.2 as of when I am writing this, it is from https://xeno.onl

## 3.
This step is like a reminder: remember to attach your executor to your roblox player and then join word bomb in order to execute neo-unpatchabomb.
